## SMEIRL for Hand Trajectory Prediction (Pointing Task)

This repository provides a modular implementation of Sampling-based Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (SMEIRL) to predict the intended target during rapid hand movements in virtual and mixed reality environments.

## Features
- Implements SMEIRL with custom trajectory sampler for pointing task
- Features: distance, velocity, acceleration, jerk
- Quadratic velocity profile-based hand motion generation
- Saves learned reward weights
- Designed for use with real or synthetic hand trajectory data (or any time series data)

## Quick Start
```bash
python demo.py
```

## Dataset Access
